AirBnB clone - The console:

     -description of the project:

This project involves developing a web application similar to Airbnb, but with a console-based interface. The main objective is to create the backend of the application, focusing on business logic and essential features, while allowing testing of these features through a console shell.

Key Features:

1- User Management: Allow registration, login, and user profile management.
2-Listings Management: Enable creation, modification, deletion, and searching of property listings.
3-Booking Management: Allow users to book available properties, cancel bookings, and view booking history.
4-Search Functionality: Enable users to search for properties based on various criteria such as location, price, amenities, etc.
5-Review Management: Allow users to leave reviews for properties and view reviews left by other users.


Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python
Web Framework: Flask or Django (depending on preferences and project requirements)
Database: SQLite or PostgreSQL (for storing user data, listings, bookings, etc.)
Console Shell: Utilize the Python console or a tool like IPython for testing and interacting with the backend.
The project will be developed following software development best practices, including unit testing to ensure code reliability. Emphasis will be placed on code modularity and maintainability to allow for easy scalability of the application.



Project Objectives:

Develop a functional backend for a property rental application with a console-based user interface.
Test backend functionalities using a console shell to simulate user interactions.
Implement basic features such as user management, listings, bookings, searches, and reviews.
Ensure code quality by following software development best practices and performing unit testing.
Document the code to facilitate understanding and future maintenance of the project.
This project will provide hands-on experience in backend web development, as well as in designing and implementing a console-based user interface.
